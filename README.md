# end-to-end-simulation-hello-world

A rust implementation of the code described in [this article](https://safetydave.net/end-to-end-simulation-hello-world/), and [associated Python Notebook](https://github.com/safetydave/maths-whimsy/blob/main/simulation/simulation_hello_world.ipynb) just to get practice writing simulations.
